# CS450 Final Project: Carlsbad Windmill Animation

## About
This repository contains the source code for my final project submission for the CS450 (Introduction to Computer Graphics) course at Oregon State University, Fall Quarter 2023. The project showcases an animated scene representing the Carlsbad Windmill in Carlsbad, CA, incorporating various aspects of 3D computer graphics learned throughout the course.

### Project Video

## Project Requirements
The project was aimed at applying comprehensive 3D computer graphics knowledge to a personally significant application. It involved:

- Serious 3D computer graphics.
- Implementation of textures, lighting, shaders, and shadows as per choice.
- The project was inspired by existing work but represents my own implementation.
- The project was completed within a one-week timeframe.

## Features
- Animated scene of the Carlsbad Windmill.
- Utilization of textures for a realistic appearance.
- Dynamic lighting to simulate different times of the day.
- Shader programs to enhance visual effects.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- OpenGL
- GLSL for shader programming
- FreeGLUT for the windowing application
- GLEW for managing OpenGL extensions
- GLM for mathematics

## Setup and Running
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have OpenGL, GLEW, and FreeGLUT installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory and compile the project using the provided Makefile: `make`
4. Run the compiled executable to launch the animation: `./sample`

## Project Structure
- `glm/`: Contains GLM files for OpenGL mathematics.
- `*.cpp` & `*.h`: Source and header files for the project components.
- `*.bmp`: Texture files used in the project.

## Acknowledgements
This project was completed as part of the requirements for the CS450 course at Oregon State University, under the guidance of Mike Bailey, PhD.
